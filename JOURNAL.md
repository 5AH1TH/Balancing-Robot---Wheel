# Summary --
This project is a two-wheeled robot that can balance itself to stay upright at all times, even when given a push. It is designed to move forware, backward and turn using two separate motors. This robot has a lower center of gravity, hence the height. Furthermore, the robot features a carefully balanced chassis with different platforms screwed on to the outer box, holding the motors, batteries, and the rpi-cm5. It runs on two brushed DC motors connected to the wheels via bevel gears. The robot's structure is optimized for passive stability: a wide wheelbase and a low center of gravity to help reduce tipping. This project is part of a bigger one. I'm conducting a study to determine the optimal robot: a wheel based robot with no hip and knee actuators, a leg based robot with hip and knee actuators (but with no wheels), and a hybrid, a combination of two, where the robot can switch between legs and wheels to traverse terrain easier and faster. My hypothesis is that a hybrid will work the best for traveling rough terrain.



# DAY 1 --

Learned and researched about different kinds of self-balancing robots, and all the different parts needed. There are three types of balancing robots: The ones with wheels that don't have hip and leg joints,

the ones without wheels (and with hip and leg joints),
