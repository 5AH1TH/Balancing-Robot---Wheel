# Summary --
This project is a two-wheeled robot that can balance itself to stay upright at all times, even when given a push. It is designed to move forware, backward and turn using two separate motors. This robot has a lower center of gravity, hence the height. Furthermore, the robot features a carefully balanced chassis with different platforms screwed on to the outer box, holding the motors, batteries, and the rpi-cm5. It runs on two brushed DC motors connected to the wheels via bevel gears. The robot's structure is optimized for passive stability: a wide wheelbase and a low center of gravity to help reduce tipping. This project is part of a bigger one. I'm conducting a study to determine the optimal robot: a wheel based robot with no hip and knee actuators, a leg based robot with hip and knee actuators (but with no wheels), and a hybrid, a combination of two, where the robot can switch between legs and wheels to traverse terrain easier and faster. My hypothesis is that a hybrid will work the best for traveling rough terrain.

Learned and researched about different kinds of self-balancing robots, and all the different parts needed. There are three types of balancing robots: 
The ones with wheels that don't have hip and leg joints,

the ones without wheels (and with hip and leg joints),

and the ones with wheels and hip and leg joints.

The pros of option 1 is that its simple, easy and compact.
The cons of option 1 is that it isn't very good in rugged terrain, and there isn't much flexibility with it either.

The pros of option 2 is that its pretty reliable, and can traverse terrain easier.
The cons of option 2 is that its really complex and hard to code, as using complicated machine learning is the only way to get it to reliably work.

The pros of option 3 is that its very reliable as being able to switch betwween wheels and legs makes the robot more adaptive of the environment. For example, if there is rugged terrain, the robot switches to legs, but if there is smoother terrain, the robot switches to wheels to make it go faster and to save energy.
The cons of option 3 is that it is pretty hard to cad out.

I also began drafting rough mechanical sketches of the layout of the robot. I focused on identifying how to place the essential components like motors, batteries so the center of gravity would remain low and centralized. I also looked into bevel gears to ensure that the motor will be able to spin the wheels at the optimal position. I also fixed some errors about placement and issues like motor torque alignment and wheel spin direction.
