# Summary --
This project is a two-wheeled robot that can balance itself to stay upright at all times, even when given a push. It is designed to move forware, backward and turn using two separate motors. This robot has a lower center of gravity, hence the height. Furthermore, the robot features a carefully balanced chassis with different platforms screwed on to the outer box, holding the motors, batteries, and the rpi-cm5. It runs on two brushed DC motors connected to the wheels via bevel gears. The robot's structure is optimized for passive stability: a wide wheelbase and a low center of gravity to help reduce tipping. This project is part of a bigger one. I'm conducting a study to determine the optimal robot: a wheel based robot with no hip and knee actuators, a leg based robot with hip and knee actuators (but with no wheels), and a hybrid, a combination of two, where the robot can switch between legs and wheels to traverse terrain easier and faster. My hypothesis is that a hybrid will work the best for traveling rough terrain.



# DAY 1 --

Learned and researched about different kinds of self-balancing robots, and all the different parts needed. There are three types of balancing robots: 
The ones with wheels that don't have hip and leg joints,

the ones without wheels (and with hip and leg joints),

and the ones with wheels and hip and leg joints.

The pros of option 1 is that its simple, easy and compact.

The cons of option 1 is that it isn't very good in rugged terrain, and there isn't much flexibility with it either.



The pros of option 2 is that its pretty reliable, and can traverse terrain easier.

The cons of option 2 is that its really complex and hard to code, as using complicated machine learning is the only way to get it to reliably work.



The pros of option 3 is that its very reliable as being able to switch betwween wheels and legs makes the robot more adaptive of the environment. For example, if there is rugged terrain, the robot switches to legs, but if there is smoother terrain, the robot switches to wheels to make it go faster and to save energy.

The cons of option 3 is that it is pretty hard to cad out.

I also began drafting rough mechanical sketches of the layout of the robot. I focused on identifying how to place the essential components like motors, batteries so the center of gravity would remain low and centralized. I also looked into bevel gears to ensure that the motor will be able to spin the wheels at the optimal position (90 degrees). I also fixed some errors about placement and issues like motor torque alignment and wheel spin direction (in the diagram).

I started the CAD design in Onshape. I also started modeled the two-wheel configuration and built the basic structural frame that holds the motors and battery pack, which is essentially the outside box.

I also created motor mounts with correct shaft spacing to fit perfectly within the limitations of the box. Faced a challenge getting the shaft alignment correct for the bevel gear pairing because the gear distance calculator was extremely specific.

# Day 4 --

Refined CAD model. I modeled it so that everything would be perfectly symmetrical to ensure the best reliability. I also added the platform on top to hold all the electronics.

Platform on top:

As said before, I focused heavily on weight distribution, keeping the motors lower and the compute module higher. I also found every single part I would need for the cad. What I used in my cad were bevel gears, motors, shafts, and ball bearings. I also need screws to attach the separate parts to the box.


Time taken: 4-5 hours

# Day 5 --

I worked on modeled the bevel gear assembly and figured out placement of the 4 mm round shaft for wheel drive. I worked on cadding the gears to be the optimal distance apart, which was provided by the gear distance calculator. Ensured the bevel gears had the proper 90Â° interface to match the motor and wheel axes. This took a long time because making everything symmetrical meant that whenever I made a big change to the design, I had to constantly check the placement of the gears and motors to make sure they were still in the right position. If they weren't, I would spend at least 25 minutes fixing it to find the problem, and fix it in a way that doesn't affect any other components. The bevel gear assembly also includes this cantilever structure to help stabilize the shaft as one point of contact would just make the shaft bend.
