# Balancing-Robot---Wheel

This project is a two-wheeled robot that can balance itself to stay upright at all times, even when given a push. It is designed to move forware, backward and turn using two separate motors. This robot has a lower center of gravity, hence the height. Furthermore, the robot features a carefully balanced chassis with different platforms screwed on to the outer box, holding the motors, batteries, and the rpi-cm5. It runs on two brushed DC motors connected to the wheels via bevel gears.
